       <h2>2 METHODOLOGY</h2>
       
       Franmarine Underwater Services Pty Ltd have been appointed by the client Pacific Basin to conduct a 
       Biofouling Inspection in accordance with New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries (NZMPI) Craft Risk 
       Management Standard (CRMS) for biofouling on vessels arriving New Zealand on the vessel MV Bunun Ace. 
       <p/>
       The inspection work was conducted by qualified divers trained in under water inspection techniques and in 
       accordance with client requirements and time schedules. All work was documented using CCTV and HD still 
       photography.
       <p/>
       Diving operations were conducted from DSV Integrity III using a 4-person dive team in accordance with AS/NZS 
       2299.1:2015.
       <p/>
       Documents used to assist the project:

       • AS/NZS 2299.1:2015
       • Franmarine Operations Manual
       • NZ MPI Craft Risk Management Standard
       • Underwater Inspection Handbook
       • Chief Engineers information on the day
