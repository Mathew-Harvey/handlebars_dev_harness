        <h4>2. METHODOLOGY</h4>

        Franmarine Underwater Services Pty Ltd have been appointed by the client Pacific Basin to conduct a
        Biofouling Inspection in accordance with New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries (NZMPI) Craft Risk
        Management Standard (CRMS) for biofouling on vessels arriving New Zealand on the vessel MV Bunun Ace.
        <p />
        The inspection work was conducted by qualified divers trained in under water inspection techniques and in
        accordance with client requirements and time schedules. All work was documented using CCTV and HD still
        photography.
        <p />
        Diving operations were conducted from DSV Integrity III using a 4-person dive team in accordance with AS/NZS
        2299.1:2015.
        <p />
